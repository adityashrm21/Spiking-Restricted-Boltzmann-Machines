# Spiking-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machines
Applications and build-up over basic SRBM implementation

### Motivation behind this work

- Daniel Neil's master's thesis on [Online Learning in Event-based Restricted Boltzmann Machines](http://dannyneil.com/attach/dneil_thesis.pdf)


### Prospective Ideas

- Make a deep belief network by stacking multiple SRBMs.
